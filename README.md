# Image-hover-border-image-shrink

A simple project that shows how to animate the borders around image with use of transition effect and pseudo-elements. Additionally image shrinks when hovering over it. 
If you are looking for something less ‘sophisticated’ here -> https://github.com/noszczykmichal/image-hover-border
is the basic version of this project only with borders being animated.
